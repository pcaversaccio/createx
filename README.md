Factory smart contract to make easier and safer usage of the [`CREATE`](https://www.evm.codes/#f0?fork=shanghai) and [`CREATE2`](https://www.evm.codes/#f5?fork=shanghai) EVM opcodes as well as of [`CREATE3`](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/3171)-based contract creations.

## Features

TBD (elaborate here what is all possible)

## Unit Tests

## Test Coverage

This project repository uses [`forge coverage`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-coverage). Simply run:

```console
forge coverage
```

The written tests available in the directory [`test`](./test) achieve a test coverage of **100%** for the [`CreateX`](./src/CreateX.sol) contract:

```console
| File            | % Lines           | % Statements      | % Branches      | % Funcs         |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| src/CreateX.sol | 100.00% (149/149) | 100.00% (210/210) | 100.00% (78/78) | 100.00% (31/31) |
```

> **Important:** A test coverage of 100% does not mean that there are no vulnerabilities. What really counts is the quality and spectrum of the tests themselves!
